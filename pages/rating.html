          <p>Summary: Inspired by the adventure and imagination that we love from classic science-fiction,
            No Man's Sky presents you with a galaxy to explore, filled with unique planets and lifeforms,
            and constant danger and action. In No Man's Sky, every star is the light of a distant sun,
            each orbited by planets filled with life, and you can go to any of them you choose.
            Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. 
            In this infinite procedurally generated universe, 
            you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.</p>

            <p class="explanation">These games leave us with something outstanding to remember them by,
               usually novel gameplay ideas for single-player or multiplayer,
                clever characters and writing, noteworthy graphics and sound, or some combination thereof.
                 If we have major complaints, there are more than enough excellent qualities to cancel them out.</p>

          <p>In 2019, No Man&#39;s Sky is the water fight of games. When your water balloons are stacked high and your water gun is full it&#39;s an absolute blast.
            But inevitably, you run out of liquid ammunition and have to pause for several minutes, soaking wet and shivering, 
            while you operate a hose and refill your stores for the next round of fun. 
            While the recent Beyond represents another significant step in the right direction for No Man&#39;s Sky that improves itself in almost every area, 
            the uninteresting harvesting and survival mechanics that underlie it all remain incredibly grindy and frequently mind-numbingly tedious. 
            It often feels like it&#39;s been made by two teams with opposing views on game design, who are each tugging at either side of it until eventually agreeing to meet in the middle or tear it in half.</p>

          <p>What started off as a bare-bones skeleton of a procedurally-generated space exploration game has been masterfully crafted into something worth sinking hours of time into.
            From a sophisticated base-building system to breath-taking landscapes, there is something for players of all types and experience levels to explore.</p>
