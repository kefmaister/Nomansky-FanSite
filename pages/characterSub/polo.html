            <h1 class="characterTitle">The Lore</h1>
            <p class="characterText">In the storyline quest The First Traveller, the Player is taken to a remote outpost.
                 Searching its logs reveal that it was previously a salvage station, manned by an inquisitive Gek (Polo), 
                 sent to work there as a translator as a punishment for their behaviour. In the salvaged wrecks, 
                 Polo found data speaking of worlds that did not exist and events that didn't happen. One day, 
                 they went out to investigate a crashed freighter following an active Korvax life sign (Nada).
                  Neither of them returned after that.
            </p>
  
            <p class="characterText">The outpost's logs gives the location of the crashed freighter where Polo presumably first met Nada.
                The freighter's logs are written in first person by a version of Polo from another dimension, 
                one where all life was annihilated by the then-peaceful Sentinels, for an unknown reason, 
                in a violent attack that lasted less than an hour. 
                Nada saved Polo in their freighter and they both travelled to the centre of their galaxy while being chased by the Sentinels.
                At the end of the log, this Polo is attacked by the Sentinels and dies, but not before telling Nada that they shall meet again in another universe.
            </p>
  
            <p class="characterText">It is still unknown how Nada and Polo came aboard the Space Anomaly.</p>
