              <p class="characterText">Apollo is a Traveller who the player meets as part of the Artemis Path.
                 Apollo was once a flesh and blood Traveller like the player, but have had their bodies fully replaced by robotics in some part of their past.
                  They seem to be concerned only with units, and have come to the conclusion that money is the only thing that matters in life.

              <p class="characterText">Apollo, if they were given a specific address,
                 contacts the player immediately after a Holo-Terminus conversation with -null- and is surprised at being unable to find the player despite being in the same location. 
                 The conversation is interrupted by a distress signal before it can progress much further.

          <p class="characterText">The player first learns of the existence of Apollo when Artemis transmits their ID just before disappearing from the Holo-Terminus network.</p>

          <p class="characterText">The player first contacts Apollo via Holo-Terminus. 
            Apollo is initially uninterested, but the player gains their attention once they are informed of Artemis's misfortune. 
            Eventually, the player decides to work with Apollo to uncover the connection between Portals and the Sentinels.
        </p>

          <p class="characterText">To this end, Apollo, demanding that the player be sufficiently prepared for the tasks ahead,
             refers them to several of his contacts to receive upgrades and gain the ability to build a base staffed with an Overseer (NPC) and a Scientist.
              Once the player has finished preparations, Apollo observes Sentinel activity while the player raids a Korvax Manufacturing Facility.

          <h1 class="characterTitle">Apollo Mythology</h1>
          <p class="characterText">Apollo is named after the Greek God Apollo, who has been recognized as a god of archery,
             music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the Sun and light, poetry, and more.
              He was the son of Zeus and Leto, and the twin brother of Artemis,
               which has lead some No Man's Sky Community Members to believe that Apollo
                might be the brother of the Traveller named Artemis or their friendship was so close that they consider each other brother and sister.
