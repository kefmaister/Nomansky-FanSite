              <p class="characterText">Artemis is a member of the Traveller species and a central character in the main
                storyline of No Man's Sky. The character was introduced in the Atlas Rises update.</p>
                <p>is named after the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. This has led some
                No Man's Sky Community Members to believe that Artemis might be the sister of the Traveller named Apollo
                or their friendship was so close that they consider each other brother and sister.</p>

            <div class="characterContent">
              <h1 class="characterTitle">The Artemis Path</h1>
              <p class="characterText">The main storyline of No Man's Sky, also known as the Artemis Path,
                 involves the player character uncovering the mysteries of Artemis and the Fourth Race, as well as the true nature of the Atlas, the Portals,
                  and the universe of the game as a whole.
                  The other storyline is Atlas Path, in which the player visits Atlas Interfaces and crafts Atlas Seeds to progress.
                  (Players who started the Atlas Path before the Update 1.30 followed different quests related to Atlas Stones instead of the Atlas Seeds.)

          <h1 class="characterTitle">First appearance</h1>
          <p class="characterText">The player first learns of the existence of Artemis when they come upon their Crashed
            Ship and find their ID in its Distress Beacon. When they leave the planet, the player is contacted by
            Artemis and learns of their plight.</p>

          <p class="characterText">Soon after, the player contacts Artemis again, this time via Holo-Terminus. In this
            conversation, Artemis tells the player to triangulate their position by using a Signal Booster at three
            specific locations.</p>

          <p class="characterText">Once the data has been collected, the player contacts Artemis again via Holo-Terminus
            and receives data concerning the stars around their location.
            Artemis asks the player to communicate with the local dominant race and enlist their aid in plotting a
            course from the player's location to the location of Artemis.
            The player finds out from the local lifeforms that Artemis's location does not exist; when the player
            contacts them once more over Holo-Terminus to relay the bad news, Artemis is attacked by hostile creatures,
            but transmits the ID for Apollo as they disappear from the Holo-Terminus network.</p>

          <h1 class="characterTitle">Artemis Mythology</h1>
          <p class="characterText">In ancient Greek mythology and religion, Artemis is the goddess of the hunt, the wilderness,
            wild animals, nature, vegetation, childbirth, care of children, and chastity.
            She was heavily identified with Selene, the Moon, and Hecate, another Moon goddess, and was thus regarded as one of the most prominent lunar deities in mythology,
            alongside the aforementioned two.
            She would often roam the forests of Greece, attended by her large entourage, mostly made up of nymphs, some mortals, and hunters.
            The goddess Diana is her Roman equivalent.
