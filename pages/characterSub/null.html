                 The Atlas told me I could never see them all. There were too many. So I did what I had to do. I survived in the face of eternity. 
                 I saw all the worlds of my own universe.

          <p class="characterText">The player unintentionally contacts -null- via Holo-Terminus. 
            Null has an existential conversation with the player, then tells them that Artemis can be brought back to life, after a fashion,
             using a device called a Mind Arc. After -null- gives the player the device's Blueprint, 
             they set the Holo-Terminus to Artemis's frequency so that the player can capture their soul once they have crafted a Mind Arc.
          </p>
          <p class="characterText">After the player captures Artemis in a Mind Arc, they contact -null- again via Holo-Terminus.
             After speaking of the foundation of existence, -null- directs the player to space for further help with Artemis.

            <h1 class="characterTitle">The Lore</h1>
            <p class="characterText">-null- was once a Traveller from another universe who defied the Atlas and lived for an eternity in order to discover and explore all the star systems and planets of their universe.
               In response, the Atlas showed them that they were still just one of many travellers in an infinite multiverse,
                what -null- interpreted as his actions being meaningless, causing much grief. After that meeting Atlas stopped speaking to -null-,
                 but -null- having the new understanding and a knowledge of the walls between universes failing, decided to contact the player in order to find out what's wrong with the multiverse.
              </p>
  
            <p class="characterText">Soon after, the player contacts Artemis again, this time via Holo-Terminus. In this
              conversation, Artemis tells the player to triangulate their position by using a Signal Booster at three
              specific locations.</p>
  
            <p class="characterText">Once the data has been collected, the player contacts Artemis again via Holo-Terminus
              and receives data concerning the stars around their location.
              Artemis asks the player to communicate with the local dominant race and enlist their aid in plotting a
              course from the player's location to the location of Artemis.
              The player finds out from the local lifeforms that Artemis's location does not exist; when the player
              contacts them once more over Holo-Terminus to relay the bad news, Artemis is attacked by hostile creatures,
              but transmits the ID for Apollo as they disappear from the Holo-Terminus network.</p>
